# Welcome to the BioMate Documetation

BioMate represents a collection of scripts and utility tools for everyday processing of biological data, conveniently gathered into a single Python package.

To check the package information and available sub-commands, you can run `biomate --help`.

## Available tools

- [Blabber](blabber.md) - FASTA, FASTQ or plain text sequence generator. It can be used to re-generate a flowcell folder using a sample sheet as input.
- [Dirstruct](dirstruct.md) - Extract or create a directory structure. It can be used to simulate nested folder structures for testing purposes.
- [Index](index.md) - Indexing tool for FASTA/FASTQ files. It can be used to search for expected indexes and get 'fuzzy' information.
